## Organizing Buildings

We strongly recommend checking out two guides in particular for organizing
buildings during COVID-19:

* [This guide][tanc] by Tenants And Neighborhood Councils out of the Bay Area
  provides specific step-by-step instructions, as well as information about
  keeping organizing accessible to native speakers of multiple languages.

* [This guide][philly] by the Philadelphia Tenants Union is equally excellent,
  but focuses more on general organizing techniques.

[tanc]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1osMMHmOn3nyhx3Or4HzKtRaeaRAyEDwnQRAtVDgt47c/edit
[philly]: https://docs.google.com/document/d/16s-CHN29u01j3VdGJGOehhYliqeCAH9ux0yE9yCVujI/edit

In addition, we have some documents that can be useful in the process of
organizing a building:

* Start establishing connections in your building by handing this [fillable
  flyer][] to neighbors or slip it under their doors if they aren't at home.
  Make sure to wash your hands before handling it!

* Move from a group of neighbors who talk to each other to a tenant council with
  actual power by getting everyone to sign this [got your back pledge][]. Please
  adapt it as needed to your building's particular circumstances.

* Once enough neighbors have signed the pledge, send [a letter to your
  landlord][] (or property manager) declaring your tenants' council and making
  your demands. Again, adapt this letter as much as you see fit—every building
  is different!

A coalition of local housing activists have also put together [a guide to rent
striking][noblogs] that’s particularly useful once your building starts to get
more organized.

## Doing Research

In collaboration with the [Seattle Solidarity Network][], we've created a
[landlord research guide][] for figuring out who owns your building and which
other buildings they own. This can help you connect with tenants in other
buildings owned by the same person and create a powerful coalition with lots of
leverage to negotiate demands.

[Seattle Solidarity Network]: https://seasol.net

The [Tenants Union of Washington State][] is another a great resource.. While
PSTU is focused on organizing to build tenant power, TUWS focuses more on
collating and distributing information related to tenants' rights. They even
have a [tenants' rights hotline][] to answer any immediate questions you may
have.

### Eviction Moratoriums

Wondering which eviction moratorium you’re covered by and what the details are?
[This spreadsheet][] lists all known eviction moratoriums in effect across
Washington. And no matter what, you’re covered by the statewide moratorium:
**your landlord can’t give you a 14-day non-payment eviction notice or a 20 day
no-cause eviction notice until April 17th** (unless the eviction is "necessary
to ensure the health and safety of the tenant or other individuals").

[This spreadsheet]: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JChVH-SwPZ6W_TpnRS-9nXmJldcTArrAbl-bJiX4sno/edit

If your landlord is serving notices despite this, you can start by [filing an
official complaint][]. But the best way to ensure you and your neighbors will be
treated humanely now and in the future is by organizing your building, and [we
can help](/contact/)!

## Mutual Aid

There are a bunch of mutual aid groups around the city connecting people with
the capacity to donate and deliver groceries and supplies to people who need
them. If you’re in Seattle, the biggest network is
[#covid19mutualaid][]:

* [Request aid][request-en] ([Español][request-es], [አማርኛ][request-am], [ትግርኛ][request-tir], [Tiếng Việt][request-vi])
* [Volunteer][volunteer-en] ([Español][volunteer-es], [አማርኛ][volunteer-am], [ትግርኛ][volunteer-tir], [Tiếng Việt][volunteer-vi])
* [Donate][]

If you’re not in Seattle, It’s Going Down has compiled [a list of mutual aid
organizations][] across the Pacific Northwest.

If you’re short on rent, the Seattle Solidarity Network has set up
[rentrelief.net][] to help coordinate donations and organize buildings.

## Posters

Want to help spread the word about PSTU? We've got [a poster][] you can print at
home and put up on nearby telephone poles or other surfaces. Tape works fine,
but the easiest and cheapest way to do it is by [wheatpasting][].
