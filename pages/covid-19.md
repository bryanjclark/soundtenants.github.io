The Puget Sound Tenants Union wants to organize with tenants in response to the
current crisis, guided by two simple goals: **We are organizing to demand rent
suspensions and rent forgiveness from landlords for as long as the crisis
continues.** If you’re struggling to pay rent because of the pandemic, [let’s
talk](/contact/)!

Withholding our rent collectively is our leverage to demand rent suspension for
those who can’t pay. Talk to everyone who lives in your building to find out who
needs help and who’s willing to do the right thing. We’re standing together for
everyone’s right to shelter!

## Staying Safe

Organizing has traditionally relied on face-to-face conversations. Doing this
during the pandemic poses particular challenges. You can still meet your
neighbors by going door-to-door, but make sure to stay safe:

* Wear a mask. Medical-grade is best, but homemade is okay if you don't have
  one.

* Once you knock on a door, stand as far back from it as you can. This isn't
  just safe, it's respectful!

* Keep your conversations short. Explain why you’re there and ask for contact
  info to keep talking without in-person interaction.

* If you’re handing out [flyers][]:

  * Wash your hands before you prepare them and before you hand them out. If you
    touch your face, wash them again! You can never be too sure.
  * Provide safety instructions on the flier: "this was handled carefully with
    clean hands, but please wash your hands after touching it just in case!"
  * Gloves are good, but they aren’t magic. Putting on a new pair of gloves is
    about the same as one thorough hand wash.
