Housing is a human right, not a commodity to be traded on the market at the
expense of people. We want to stop the trifecta of landlords, city government,
and developers who profit from controlling our access to shelter by building
tenant power from the bottom up.

In the Puget Sound region, developer and landlord profits have been consistently
prioritized over our quality of life. Existing avenues for combating rising
rents, slumlord behavior, and evictions usually go through non-profit
organizations. While these organizations can provide important resources for
tenants, they’re unable to challenge the root of the problem that we face: the
subjugation of housing to the market. The only way we can end the exploitation
of everyone’s need for shelter is to get organized and make our demands heard
together.

We encourage tenants of private landlords and public housing to join us and
organize your buildings and communities. If you want to help lower rents, ensure
timely maintenance, end landlord harassment, or solve any other housing
issue—[get ahold of us](/contact/)!
